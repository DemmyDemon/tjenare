Webserver built for my specific needs

All I really need is to serve some files based on what subdomain is requested, and maybe some reverse proxying.

No need for all the fancy schmancy configuration options of a real web server when I can get away with a tiny Go project to cover the same needs.

**DO NOT** base any of your own work on this, as it *will* change without notice as my needs change. Fork instead.
